# Todo list Kata

This is a kata to practice everything you've learned in the first six weeks of bootcamp.

## Your mission is

Build a todo list where a user can view / add / edit / delete todo items using react and a local api.

## Recommended strategy

### Tackle the project using vertical slices that are fully functional
  1. User can view a list of tasks from the database
  2. User can add a task
  3. User can edit a task
  4. User can delete a task
  5. User can complete a task
  6. User can view all completed tasks
 
### Code from the outside in
  1. Start by building the html of a components render method
  2. Build your reducers and connect your components 
  3. Add event handlers for any interactive elements
  4. Build the client side api code
  5. Create the server side api code
  6. Create your database migrations / seeds 
  7. Create your knex code
  
### Test each step as you build it
